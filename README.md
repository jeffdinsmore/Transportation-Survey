## Description

_Transportation Survey
Similar to the site depicted in the previous lesson, create a website that prompts users to fill out a survey regarding which methods of transportation they've used to get to work in the past year. Include at least five options for users to select from.

Then, once you can successfully gather data from one question, include a second survey question asking users which methods of transportation they've used to travel to non-work or recreational activities. This second question should use a second set of checkboxes.
